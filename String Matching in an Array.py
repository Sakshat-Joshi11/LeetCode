Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that are a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
